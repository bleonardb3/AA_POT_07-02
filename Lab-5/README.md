# Lab-5 AutoAI + DevOps

This lab consists of two parts. The first part will demonstrate the new and exciting AutoAI capability to build and deploy an optimized model based on the Titanic data set. The second part will deploy an application using the IBM Cloud DevOps toolchain that will invoke the deployed model to predict whether a passenger would have survived.
